# Churn-Prediction
Customer churn prediction with ANN.

**Dataset**: ChurModeling.csv <br/>
**Deep Learning Algorithm**: Artificial Neural Network <br/>
**Libraries**: TensorFlow 2.9.2, Keras

The Churn_Modeling dataset contains informations about customers of a bank such as their Credit Score, Age, Tenure, balance, etc.

If we can predict which customers are more likely to leave the bank, we can plan a strategy to hold them, that's the GOAL!

**N.B.**: The data I have used do not come from a real company. Instead, they are fake data that simulates a real scenario.
